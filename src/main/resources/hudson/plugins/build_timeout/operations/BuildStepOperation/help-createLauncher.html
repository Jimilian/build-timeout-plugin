Build steps like "Execute shell", "Execute Windows batch command" and so on, requires Launcher object to execute an external program.
Build Timeout does not provide Launcher for build steps by default and those build steps fail.
Checking here provides the build step a new created Launcher.
You should not check here as long as the build step can run without this (that is, it does not require an external program).
